# ece391-os

 Minimalist operating system built from scratch. The terminal uses the x86 infrastructure and implements many 
 Linux-based features. The operating systems supports paging, multiple terminals, mutli-threading, scheduling,
 and the ability to load and execute C programs! The project is developed in x86 assembly and low level C language. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Making sense of the code

Open the ```student-distrib``` file to look at the raw source code for the operating system. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
